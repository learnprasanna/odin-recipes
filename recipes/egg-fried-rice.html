    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure that the steamed rice is cooled and preferably a day old to reduce moisture.
            Dice all vegetables and protein into uniform-sized pieces for even cooking.
            Beat the eggs in a bowl and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
        <li>Place a wok or a large, deep pan on high heat.
            Add a tablespoon of cooking oil and allow it to heat until it shimmers.</li>
        <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the hot wok or pan.
            Allow them to set for a moment before scrambling with a spatula.
            Once the eggs are cooked through, remove them from the wok and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add a bit more oil to the wok if needed.
            Stir-fry the diced carrots until they start to soften.
            Add the peas and any additional protein (chicken or beef) and cook until the protein is browned and cooked through.
            Add the minced garlic and continue to stir-fry until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Break up any clumps in the day-old steamed rice and add it to the wok.
            Use a spatula to toss and stir the rice, ensuring it mixes evenly with the vegetables and protein.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle salt, white pepper, and MSG (if using) over the rice. Adjust the seasoning according to taste.
            Pour soy sauce evenly over the rice and continue to stir-fry.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is well-coated with the seasonings, reintroduce the cooked eggs to the wok.
            Stir to combine all ingredients thoroughly.</li>
        <li> Add chopped green onions, stirring briefly to incorporate.
            Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Once everything is well-mixed and heated through, transfer the fried rice to a serving dish.</li>
    </ol>
